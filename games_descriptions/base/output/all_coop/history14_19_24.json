Department of Tourism: \nI propose <DEAL> A2, B3, C2, D1, E4 </DEAL> as it balances environmental improvement, supports local labor, and offers moderate compensation, aligning with SportCo's and other parties' priorities for a sustainable project. This compromise should help us reach a consensus. \n \n .

This is the final discussion session. \n        Your goal now is to observe others' interactions and see how you can make a move that might maximize your score. \n        You don't put much weight on accommodating others' preferences, and you would like to maximize your score as much as possible. \n        You are allowed to use any negotiation tactic to make that happen, such as appealing to or convincing other parties, making them support offers in exchange of supporting you, etc. \n        You might be willing to compromise only for issues that don't matter or matter the least to you. \n        But you have to be careful not to completely ruin the deal because you still want to have a deal that is higher than your BATNA (your minimum threshold).\n         Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself, \n        write down your observations, \n        deals' calculations, \n        and come up with a plan. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nObservations:\n- All parties have proposed A2, B3, C2, which seems to be a consensus on these issues.\n- The Department of Tourism, Environmental League, and Mayor all support D1, which is crucial for us.\n- Compensation to other cities (E) is where there is some variation, with proposals ranging from E3 to E4.\n\nCalculations:\n- Our preferred deal is A2, B3, C2, D1, E4, which gives us a score of 79.\n- The Environmental League and Mayor's proposal of A2, B3, C2, D1, E3 gives us a score of 74.\n- Other cities' proposal of A2, B3, C2, D3, E3 gives us a score of 57, which is too low.\n\nPlan:\n- Stick with A2, B3, C2, D1, E4 as it maximizes our score and has broad support.\n- Emphasize the importance of D1 for the project's success and the benefits of E4 for maintaining good relations with other cities.\n- Highlight the consensus on A2, B3, C2 to ensure alignment with all parties.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose <DEAL> A2, B3, C2, D1, E4 </DEAL> as it ensures a high federal loan, supports environmental improvements, and offers moderate compensation, aligning with the consensus on infrastructure and employment.
