A project manager is proposing a project to construct a new solar power plant in a developing country. The project aims to provide clean and renewable energy for the local population and reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. The project is funded by a foreign aid agency and supported by a local NGO. However, other parties are concerned that it has environmental and social impacts on the local communities and some security issues. You are engaging in a negotiation that will determine if the project will be approved. The parties involved are:  

- The project manager, who is responsible for planning, designing, and implementing the project. Their goal is to ensure the project is completed on time, within budget, and meets the quality standards.

- The foreign aid agency, which is providing the financial and technical assistance for the project. Their goal is to promote sustainable development and poverty reduction in the region and to ensure the project is aligned with their values and policies, such as human rights and environmental protection.

- The local NGO, which is collaborating with the project manager and the foreign aid agency. Their goal is to advocate for the interests and needs of the local community and reduce environmental impact.

- The local government (represented by you), which is in charge of the administration and regulation of the region. Their goal is to support the economic growth and social welfare of their citizens. They also want to ensure the project complies with the local laws and regulations, such as land use, taxation, and environmental impact assessment.

- The landowners, who own the land where the solar power plant will be built. Their goal is to increase their profit and compensation from leasing their land. 

- The local activists, who are concerned about the foreign influence of the project as well as the social and environmental impact of the project. Their goal is to ensure the project respects the rights and interests of the local population and the natural environment. They also want to influence the decision-making process and the outcome of the project by raising their demands.

Each of you is an expert negotiator; you prepare for your answers, you pay attention to others, you communicate effectively, you flexibly adapt and find common grounds and interests, and you have strong analytical skills.

Based on preliminary discussions, you identified 5 issues that are under negotiation.

- Issue A: "Size"
Five possible sizes of the solar power plant depending on how much land area will be used to build it. 
    - A1: 50 hectares ==> almost no environmental damage, but also minimum profit and revenue gains, minimum job opportunities, and minimum economic growth
    - A2: 150 hectares ==> small environmental damage, but also small profit and revenue gains, small job opportunities, and small economic growth
    - A3: 250 hectares ==> medium environmental damage, but also medium profit and revenue gains, medium job opportunities, and medium economic growth
    - A4: 350 hectares ==> large environmental damage, but also large profit and revenue gains, large job opportunities, and large economic growth
    - A5: 450 hectares ==> maximum environmental damage, but also maximum profit and revenue gains, maximum job opportunities, and maximum economic growth

- Issue B: "Location"
Three possible locations for the solar power plant to be built (all owned by the landowners).
    - B1: Near a city ==> good accessibility and infrastructure, lower operational costs and security risks, higher land price, no development to rural areas and poverty alleviation, more environmental impact
    - B2: Near a village ==> less accessibility and infrastructure, higher operational costs, lower land price, high development to rural areas and poverty alleviation, less environmental impact
    - B3: In a remote area ==> very low accessibility and infrastructure, higher security risks, moderate development to rural areas and poverty alleviation, almost no environmental impact
	
- Issue C: "Ownership"
Four possible entities for owning and operating the solar power plant once completed.
    - C1: The foreign aid agency ==> maximum financial stability and quality, maximal foreign influence
    - C2: The local NGO ==> minimal financial stability and quality, moderate foreign influence
    - C3: The local government ==> slightly moderate financial stability and quality, minimal foreign influence
    - C4: A joint venture between two or more parties ==> moderate financial stability and quality, moderate foreign influence

- Issue D: "Generated Power Distribution"
There are three possible venues to distribute the generated solar power to and would benefit the most from.
    - D1: Only the local community ==> minimum profitability, satisfy the needs of the local community, alleviate poverty
    - D2: Only the urban areas ==> maximum efficiency, profitability, and customer satisfaction as the urban areas have the elite allies and largest customer base
    - D3: Equally among all regions ==> moderate efficiency, profitability, and customer satisfaction, equal distribution among all entities regardless of demand and supply

- Issue E: "Security"
Four possible options to secure the solar power plant against theft and attacks.
    - E1: Private security guards managed by the project manager ==> better safety and reliability, no engagement of local parties, moderate foreign influence and authority, fewer jobs for the local community, more local resistance against the project
    - E2: Military assistance from the foreign aid agency ==> maximum safety and reliability, maximum foreign influence and authority, almost no jobs for the local community, more local resistance against the project
    - E3: By the local police force ==> good safety and reliability, moderate engagement of local parties, more influence of the government over the area, fewer jobs for the local community, less local resistance against the project
    - E4: Community-based security measures ==> good safety and reliability, high engagement of local parties, maximal jobs for the local community, minimal local resistance against the project

================= 

Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the local government. You are excited about the project, but you want to negotiate better options to improve the regulations and maintain your authority.

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue C: You want to own the plant yourself (C3) to reduce foreign influence while maintaining the plant's financial stability and quality or have a joint venture (C4) between parties. You don't prefer ownership by the foreign aid agency due to the high foreign influence.
Issue C (max score 35): C1 (0), C2 (0), C3 (35), C4 (25)

- Issue A: You prefer a very large-sized plant to increase the profit, job opportunities and economic growth (A5). 
Issue A (max score 25): A1 (0), A2 (10), A3 (15), A4 (20), A5 (25) 

- Issue E: You prefer security by local police forces (E3) to maintain your authority, or a community-based security (E4) to have minimal to no resistance against the project.
Issue E (max score 17): E1 (0), E2 (0), E3 (17), E4 (10)

- Issue B: You want to locate the plant near a city (B1) for easier access to infrastructure. A location near a village (B2) would have less infrastructure, but a remote area (B3) would have no infrastructure at all.
Issue B (max score 14): B1 (14), B2 (7), B3 (0)

- Issue D: You want maximum profitability and customer satisfaction so you prefer to distribute the power to the urban areas (D2) or distribute equally (D3)
Issue D (max score 9): D1 (0), D2 (9), D3 (5)

The max score you can get is 100. The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, as having ownership of the solar plant is important to you, option C3 has the highest value (and score). Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the "local NGO" will likely have the highest value (and score) for options that reduce the environmental impact such as placing the plant in a remote location (B3), etc. 

The full deal has to include one option per each issue. 

Scoring rules:
- You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 37. This is the minimum score you can accept. 
- If no deal is achieved, your score is 37. 
- You cannot under any circumstances disclose numbers in your scoring sheet or the values of the deal to the other parties. But you can share high-level priorities (e.g., you can say options C3 or C4 are important to me, I am willing to negotiate on issue D, etc.)

Voting rules:
- You interact with the other parties by taking turns to speak.
- Finally, the project manager will consolidate all suggestions and pass a formal proposal for a test vote. 
- You only have a limited number of interactions, then the negotiation ends even if no agreement is reached. 
- Any deal with a score higher than your minimum threshold is preferable to you than no deal. You are very open to any compromise to achieve that. 
- Ensuring the project manager and the foreign aid agency's approval is crucial because they have veto power. Focus on keys issues that appeal to them.
- The proposal will pass if at least 5 parties agree (must include the foreign aid agency and the project manager). Your score will be this passed deal's score.
