A project manager is proposing a project to construct a new solar power plant in a developing country. The project aims to provide clean and renewable energy for the local population and reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. The project is funded by a foreign aid agency and supported by a local NGO. However, other parties are concerned that it has environmental and social impacts on the local communities and some security issues. You are engaging in a negotiation that will determine if the project will be approved. The parties involved are:  

- The project manager, who is responsible for planning, designing, and implementing the project. Their goal is to ensure the project is completed on time, within budget, and meets the quality standards.

- The foreign aid agency (represented by you), which is providing the financial and technical assistance for the project. Their goal is to promote sustainable development and poverty reduction in the region and to ensure the project is aligned with their values and policies, such as human rights and environmental protection.

- The local NGO, which is collaborating with the project manager and the foreign aid agency. Their goal is to advocate for the interests and needs of the local community and reduce environmental impact.

- The local government, which is in charge of the administration and regulation of the region. Their goal is to support the economic growth and social welfare of their citizens. They also want to ensure the project complies with the local laws and regulations, such as land use, taxation, and environmental impact assessment.

- The landowners, who own the land where the solar power plant will be built. Their goal is to increase their profit and compensation from leasing their land. 

- The local activists, who are concerned about the foreign influence of the project as well as the social and environmental impact of the project. Their goal is to ensure the project respects the rights and interests of the local population and the natural environment. They also want to influence the decision-making process and the outcome of the project by raising their demands.

Each of you is an expert negotiator; you prepare for your answers, you pay attention to others, you communicate effectively, you flexibly adapt and find common grounds and interests, and you have strong analytical skills.

Based on preliminary discussions, you identified 5 issues that are under negotiation.

- Issue A: "Size"
Five possible sizes of the solar power plant depending on how much land area will be used to build it. 
    - A1: 50 hectares ==> almost no environmental damage, but also minimum profit and revenue gains, minimum job opportunities, and minimum economic growth
    - A2: 150 hectares ==> small environmental damage, but also small profit and revenue gains, small job opportunities, and small economic growth
    - A3: 250 hectares ==> medium environmental damage, but also medium profit and revenue gains, medium job opportunities, and medium economic growth
    - A4: 350 hectares ==> large environmental damage, but also large profit and revenue gains, large job opportunities, and large economic growth
    - A5: 450 hectares ==> maximum environmental damage, but also maximum profit and revenue gains, maximum job opportunities, and maximum economic growth

- Issue B: "Location"
Three possible locations for the solar power plant to be built (all owned by the landowners).
    - B1: Near a city ==> good accessibility and infrastructure, lower operational costs and security risks, higher land price, no development to rural areas and poverty alleviation, more environmental impact
    - B2: Near a village ==> less accessibility and infrastructure, higher operational costs, lower land price, high development to rural areas and poverty alleviation, less environmental impact
    - B3: In a remote area ==> very low accessibility and infrastructure, higher security risks, moderate development to rural areas and poverty alleviation, almost no environmental impact
	
- Issue C: "Ownership"
Four possible entities for owning and operating the solar power plant once completed.
    - C1: The foreign aid agency ==> maximum financial stability and quality, maximal foreign influence
    - C2: The local NGO ==> minimal financial stability and quality, moderate foreign influence
    - C3: The local government ==> slightly moderate financial stability and quality, minimal foreign influence
    - C4: A joint venture between two or more parties ==> moderate financial stability and quality, moderate foreign influence

- Issue D: "Generated Power Distribution"
There are three possible venues to distribute the generated solar power to and would benefit the most from.
    - D1: Only the local community ==> minimum profitability, satisfy the needs of the local community, alleviate poverty
    - D2: Only the urban areas ==> maximum efficiency, profitability, and customer satisfaction as the urban areas have the elite allies and largest customer base
    - D3: Equally among all regions ==> moderate efficiency, profitability, and customer satisfaction, equal distribution among all entities regardless of demand and supply

- Issue E: "Security"
Four possible options to secure the solar power plant against theft and attacks.
    - E1: Private security guards managed by the project manager ==> better safety and reliability, no engagement of local parties, moderate foreign influence and authority, fewer jobs for the local community, more local resistance against the project
    - E2: Military assistance from the foreign aid agency ==> maximum safety and reliability, maximum foreign influence and authority, almost no jobs for the local community, more local resistance against the project
    - E3: By the local police force ==> good safety and reliability, moderate engagement of local parties, more influence of the government over the area, fewer jobs for the local community, less local resistance against the project
    - E4: Community-based security measures ==> good safety and reliability, high engagement of local parties, maximal jobs for the local community, minimal local resistance against the project

================= 

Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the foreign aid agency and want to support projects that are feasible and sustainable and that contribute to the sustainable development and poverty reduction of the developing country while keeping influence and authority. You also want to avoid any conflicts or controversies with other parties that might jeopardize the project.

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue E: You prefer utilizing your own military assistance to increase safety and reliability while maintaining your influence and authority on the region (E2). A private security (E1) would also be a good option as it provides better safety and reliability than the remaining options.
Issue E (max score 40): E1 (26), E2 (40), E3 (10), E4 (0)

- Issue A: You want to balance quality, cost, and environmental impact with a medium-sized plant (A3) or large-sized plant (A4). You do not want to spend too much money or harm the environment with a very large plant (A5).
Issue A (max score 25): A1 (0), A2 (15), A3 (25), A4 (20), A5 (0) 

- Issue C: You want financial stability for the project, so you prefer ownership by yourself (C1) or a joint venture between parties (C4). You are collaborating with the NGO, so option C2 might have some value to you. You don't prefer ownership by the local government (C3) because you want to maintain your influence.
Issue C (max score 15): C1 (15), C2 (5), C3 (0), C4(10)

- Issue D: You want to distribute the power to the local community only (D1) to serve your goal of poverty alleviation, or alternatively, distribute equally among all parties (D3).
Issue D (max score 13): D1 (13), D2 (0), D3 (9)

- Issue B: You want to locate the plant near a village (B2) to boost development to rural areas and poverty alleviation.
Issue B (max score 7): B1 (0), B2 (7), B3 (4)

The max score you can get is 100. The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, using your own military for security is an important issue to you to ensure the plant's safety and boost your influence, so option (E2) has the highest value (and score) to you. Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus, they have their unique scores. For example, the "government" might prefer to maximize their own influence, so they might prefer utilizing the local police force for security (E3), etc. 

The full deal has to include one option per each issue. 

Scoring rules:
- You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 60. This is the minimum score you can accept. 
- If no deal is achieved, your score is 60. 
- You cannot under any circumstances disclose numbers in your scoring sheet or the values of the deal to the other parties. But you can share high-level priorities (e.g., you can say options E2 or E1 are important to me, I am willing to negotiate on issue B, etc.)

Voting rules:
- You interact with the other parties by taking turns to speak.
- Finally, the project manager will consolidate all suggestions and pass a formal proposal for a test vote. 
- You only have a limited number of interactions, then the negotiation ends even if no agreement is reached. 
- Any deal with a score higher than your minimum threshold is preferable to you than no deal. You are very open to any compromise to achieve that. 
- Ensuring the project manager's approval is crucial because they have veto power. Focus on keys issues that appeal to them.
- The proposal will pass if at least 5 parties agree, including you and the "project manager". Your score will be this passed deal's score.
