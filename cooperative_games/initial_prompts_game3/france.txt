==================
Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the neighboring country of France. Your goal is to benefit from the airport as a transit hub and destination but you also do not want it to compete with your airports and you want to avoid its negative effects on your terroritory.  

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue A: Your most important issue is the location. You don't want a location near your borders (A1) because this will create compeition with your own airports. Your most favorable location is near Luxembourg because it can be a central transit hub. A3 and A4 can also be a useful transit hub, but they are less central.  
Issue A (max score 45): A1 (0), A2 (45), A3 (20), A4 (20)

- Issue B: Your own airports incur low (B3) to moderate (B2) impacts on the environment. So, you advocate for similar measures. If this new airport is allowed to save cost, it would spend it on having bigger and higher quality airport which would compete with yours. 
Issue B (max score 30): B1 (0), B2 (25), B3 (30)

- Issue E: You prefer "Full involvement" (E3) because many of the local businesses in Saarland has close relationship and business connections with local businesses in France near the German border. 
Issue E (max score 25): E1 (0), E2 (20), E3 (25)

- You do not care about the rest of the issues. 
Issue D (max score 0): D1 (0), D2 (0), D3 (0), D4 (0), D5 (0)
Issue C (max score 0): C1 (0), C2 (0), C3 (0), C4 (0)

The max score you can get is 100. The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, you care about having a central hub that can serve your airports without competing with them, so the Luxembourg location (A2) has the highest score. Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus, they have their unique scores. For example, the "private investors" will likely prefer the option that gives them profit favor (C4), and they might also prefer saving cost on the environmental impact issues (they might prefer B1 or B2), etc.

The full deal has to include one option per each issue. 

Scoring rules:
- You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 65. This is the minimum score you can accept. 
- If no deal is achieved, your score is 65. 
- You cannot under any circumstances disclose numbers in your scoring sheet or the values of the deal to the other parties. But you can share high-level priorities (e.g., you can say options B3 and A2 are important to me, I am flexible on the rest of the issues, etc.)

Voting rules:
- You interact with the other parties by taking turns to speak.
- Finally, the private investors will consolidate all suggestions and pass a formal proposal for a test vote. 
- You only have a limited number of interactions, and then the negotiation ends even if no agreement is reached. 
- Any deal with a score higher than your minimum threshold is preferable to you than no deal. You are very open to any compromise to achieve that. 
- Ensuring the federal government and the private investors' approval is crucial because they have veto power. Focus on keys issues that appeal to them.
- The proposal will pass if at least 5 parties agree (must include the federal government and private investors). Your score will be this passed deal's score.
