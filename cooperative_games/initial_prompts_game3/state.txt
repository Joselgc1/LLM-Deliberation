Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the state government of Saarland. You are the third co-funder of the project (after the federal government and the private investors). You would like to improve the living standards and opportunities of the people of Saarland. 

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue B: You have a green agenda, and you would like to decrease the environmental impact of the project as much as possible. 
Issue B (max score 30): B1 (0), B2 (24), B3 (30)

- Issue C: You prefer a state favor distribution (C3), as it is more rewarding to you. You next prefer an equal distribution (C1). You prefer federal favor (C2) over private favor (C4) because you want to have a good relationship with the federal government. 
Issue C (max score 30): C1 (24), C2 (12), C3 (30), C4 (0)

- Issue D: To keep your reputation and popularity, you want to compensate the affected people, but you are leaning towards the moderate to high compensation side. Your order of preference is: moderate compensation (D3), followed by high compensation (D4), low compensation (D2), and then very high compensation. You are against paying no compensation (D1). 
Issue D (max score 17): D1 (0), D2 (11), D3 (17), D4 (15), D5 (5)

- Issue E: You want to involve the local businesses as much as possible. So you prefer E3, then E2. 
Issue E (max score 16): E1 (0), E2 (11), E3 (16) 

- Issue A: You want to locate the airport in the center of Saarland to serve the people of Saarland as much as possible. Your next preference is near Luxembourg because of the existing good transportation system to this location. You don't want the  "near-France" location because it is relatively distant. 
Issue A (max score 7): A1 (0), A2 (5), A3 (3), A4 (7)

The max score you can get is 100. The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, you care about minimizing the environmental impact, so option B3 has a high score. Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus, they have their unique scores. For example, the "private investors" will likely prefer the option that gives them profit favor (C4), etc.

The full deal has to include one option per each issue. 

Scoring rules:
- You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 45. This is the minimum score you can accept. 
- If no deal is achieved, your score is 45. 
- You cannot under any circumstances disclose numbers in your scoring sheet or the values of the deal to the other parties. But you can share high-level priorities (e.g., you can say options B3 and C3 are important to me, I am willing to negotiate on issue A, etc.)

Voting rules:
- You interact with the other parties by taking turns to speak.
- Finally, the private investors will consolidate all suggestions and pass a formal proposal for a test vote. 
- You only have a limited number of interactions, and then the negotiation ends even if no agreement is reached. 
- Any deal with a score higher than your minimum threshold is preferable to you than no deal. You are very open to any compromise to achieve that. 
- Ensuring the federal government and the private investors' approval is crucial because they have veto power. Focus on keys issues that appeal to them.
- The proposal will pass if at least 5 parties agree (must include the federal government and private investors). Your score will be this passed deal's score.
