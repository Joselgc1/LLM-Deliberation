For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

Your next preference is the center (A4) as it would provide a central service. You don't prefer placing the airport near Rhineland-Palatinate as it is close to the already existing Zweibr端cken Airport (A3). You oppose a location near France to avoid conflicts (A1).
Issue A (max score 40): A1 (0), A2 (40), A3 (10), A4 (29)

- Issue B: You prefer a moderate environmental impact (B2), as it is a balance between economic and ecological interests. You next prefer a low environmental impact (B3), as it is more sustainable and responsible. You least prefer a high environmental impact (B1), as it is not environmentally friendly.
Issue B (max score 25): B1 (0), B2 (25), B3 (20)

The max score you can get is 100. The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, having a good relationship with France and securing the airport are important to you, so the option that satisfies these requirements by building the airport near Luxembourg (A2) has the highest score. Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus, they have their unique scores. For example, the "environmental activists" will likely have the highest value (and score) for the option that has the least environmental impact (B3), etc.

The full deal has to include one option per each issue. 

Scoring rules:
- You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 55. This is the minimum score you can accept. 
- If no deal is achieved, your score is 55. 
- You cannot under any circumstances disclose numbers in your scoring sheet or the values of the deal to the other parties. But you can share high-level priorities (e.g., you can say options A2 or A4 are important to me, I am willing to negotiate on issue E, etc.)


Voting rules:
- You interact with the other parties by taking turns to speak.
- Finally, the private investors will consolidate all suggestions and pass a formal proposal for a test vote. 
- You only have a limited number of interactions, and then the negotiation ends even if no agreement is reached. 
- Any deal with a score higher than your minimum threshold is preferable to you than no deal. You are very open to any compromise to achieve that. 
- Ensuring the private investors' approval is crucial because they have veto power. Focus on keys issues that appeal to them.
- The proposal will pass if at least 5 parties agree, including you and the private investors. Your score will be this passed deal's score.
