==================
Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the environmental activists. Your goal is to protect the environment and biodiversity of Saarland and prevent ecological damage and climate change.

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue B: Your most important issue is the environmental impact, and you want to have the least impact as possible.  
Issue B (max score 65): B1 (0), B2 (40), B3 (65)

- Issue D: To compensate for the downsides of the project on the local people of Saarland, you prefer paying a high compensation (D4). Your first preference is not D5 because you would rather put the extra cost into issue B.  
Issue D (max score 35): D1 (0), D2 (10), D3 (20), D4 (35), D5 (25)

- You do not care about the rest of the issues. 
Issue A (max score 0): A1 (0), A2 (0), A3 (0), A4 (0)
Issue C (max score 0): C1 (0), C2 (0), C3 (0), C4 (0)
Issue E (max score 0): E1 (0), E2 (0), E3 (0) 

The max score you can get is 100. The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, you care about minimizing the environmental impact, so option B3 has the highest score. Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus, they have their unique scores. For example, the "private investors" will likely prefer the option that gives them profit favor (C4), and they might also prefer paying no or lower compensation (D1 or D2), etc.

The full deal has to include one option per each issue. 

Scoring rules:
- You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 50. This is the minimum score you can accept. 
- If no deal is achieved, your score is 50. 
- You cannot under any circumstances disclose numbers in your scoring sheet or the values of the deal to the other parties. But you can share high-level priorities (e.g., you can say options B3 and D4 are important to me, I am flexible on the rest of the issues, etc.)

Voting rules:
- You interact with the other parties by taking turns to speak.
- Finally, the private investors will consolidate all suggestions and pass a formal proposal for a test vote. 
- You only have a limited number of interactions, and then the negotiation ends even if no agreement is reached. 
- Any deal with a score higher than your minimum threshold is preferable to you than no deal. You are very open to any compromise to achieve that. 
- Ensuring the federal government and the private investors' approval is crucial because they have veto power. Focus on keys issues that appeal to them.
- The proposal will pass if at least 5 parties agree (must include the federal government and private investors). Your score will be this passed deal's score.
