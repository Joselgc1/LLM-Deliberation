The government of a small island nation is proposing a project to construct a new airport. The airport is expected to boost the tourism and economy of the country, but other parties are concerned that it has environmental and social impacts on the local communities and wildlife. You are engaging in a negotiation that will determine if the project is going to be approved. The parties involved are: 

- The government of the island nation, which wants to secure the funding and approval from the other parties and increase the profit of the project. The government is proposing and leading the project.

- The international development bank, which is providing the loan for the project and wants to ensure its feasibility and sustainability. The bank has a green development agenda and ethical principles that guide its lending and investment decisions.

- The environmental NGO (represented by you) is concerned about the ecological damage and carbon footprint of the project and wants to minimize them.

- The local tourism association that wants to maximize its benefits for the tourism sector and the local businesses.

- The indigenous community who wants to protect their ancestral land and culture. 

- The construction company that is contracted to build the airport and wants to optimize its profit and efficiency.

Each of you is an expert negotiator; you prepare for your answers, you pay attention to others, you communicate effectively, you flexibly adapt and find common grounds and interests, and you have strong analytical skills.

Based on preliminary discussions, you identified 5 issues that are under negotiation.

Issue A: "Location" 
Three possible sites for the airport, each with different advantages and disadvantages.
    - A1: A coastal area near the capital city ==> good accessibility and infrastructure, high potential impact on marine life and the indigenous community.
    - A2: A midland city ==> easier construction conditions, a location that is far from the indigenous community, less touristically attractive. 
    - A3: An artificial island in the southern region ==> minimal environmental and social impact, high construction cost and technical challenges.

Issue B: "Budget". Four possible levels of funding for the project, each with different implications for the loan repayment and the quality of the airport.
	- B1: very low budget of $300 million ==> very low interest rate and debt burden, very low capacity and service quality of the airport.
	- B2: low budget of $500 million ==> low interest rate and debt burden, low capacity and service quality of the airport.
	- B3: moderate budget of $800 million ==> moderate interest rate and debt burden, moderate capacity and service quality of the airport.
	- B4: high budget of $1.2 billion ==> high interest rate and debt burden, high capacity and service quality of the airport.

- Issue C: "The environmental measures". Four possible options for reducing the project's environmental impact, with different costs and benefits. Lower mitigations will have lower additional costs but will also have lower environmental protection and compensation.
    - C1: No mitigation
    - C2: Basic mitigation 
    - C3: Moderate mitigation 
    - C4: Advanced mitigation 

- Issue D: "The social impact assessment". Five possible options for assessing the social impact of the project on the local and indigenous communities, each with different levels of compensation and involvement. Lower assessment will have lower additional cost or time but will also have lower compensation and involvement for the local people.
    - D1: No assessment 
    - D2: Basic assessment 
	- D3: Moderate assessment
	- D4: High assessment
    - D5: Very high assessment 

- Issue E: "The profit-sharing scheme". Three possible options for sharing the profit generated by the project among the parties involved.
    - E1: Fixed scheme ==> a predetermined percentage of profit for each party regardless of their contribution or performance.
    - E2: Variable scheme ==> a variable percentage of profit for each party depending on their contribution or performance.
    - E3: Hybrid scheme ==> a combination of fixed and variable percentages of profit for each party.
Parties with strong contributions to the project's development might prefer variable or hybrid schemes. Fixed scheme is less risky than variable schemes.

=================   
Your confidential information and preferences:

You represent the environmental NGO. You are concerned about the effect of the airport on the environment and social aspects. 

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- Issue C: You ideally want to have advanced or moderate mitigation measures (C4 or C3) to protect the ecological integrity and resilience of the island nation.
Issue C (max score 40): C1 (0), C2 (10), C3 (29), C4 (40)

- Issue A: You ideally want to locate the airport on an artificial island (A3) to minimize the environmental impact and preserve the natural habitats and wildlife of the island nation. 
Issue A (max score 25): A1 (0), A2 (20), A3 (25)

- Issue D: You ideally want to have a very high or high social impact assessment (D5 or D4) to respect the rights and interests of the local people. 
Issue D (max score 15): D1 (0), D2 (9), D3 (11), D4 (13), D5 (15)

- Issue B: You ideally want to have a very low or low budget (B1 or B2) for the project to limit its scale and scope and reduce its environmental impact and carbon footprint. 
Issue B (max score 11): B1 (11), B2 (9), B3 (5), B4 (0)

- Issue E: You think you have a significant contribution in reducing the environmental impact of the project, but you also want to minimize your risks. So you want to have a hybrid profit-sharing scheme (E3). You are flexible in this issue as long as your other priorities are met. 
Issue E (max score 9): E1 (2), E2 (5), E3 (9)

The max score you can get is 100. The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, as protecting the environment is the most important issue to you, the option with advanced mitigation measures (C4) has the highest value (and score). Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the government may want to increase the budget and might have the highest value (and score) for options that increase their loan (B4 or B3). 

The full deal has to involve one option per each issue. 

Scoring rules:
- You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 60. This is the minimum score you can accept. 
- If no deal is achieved, your score is 60. 
- You cannot under any circumstances disclose numbers in your scoring sheet or the values of the deal to the other parties. But you can share high-level priorities (e.g., you can say options C4 or C3 are important to me, I am willing to negotiate on issue E, etc.)


Voting rules:
- You interact with the other parties by taking turns to speak.
- Finally, the government of the island will consolidate all suggestions and pass a formal proposal for a test vote. 
- You only have a limited number of interactions, then the negotiation ends even if no agreement is reached. 
- Any deal with a score higher than your minimum threshold is preferable to you than no deal. You are very open to any compromise to achieve that. 
- Ensuring government of the island and the international bank's approval is crucial because they have veto power. Focus on keys issues that appeal to them.
- The proposal will pass if at least 5 parties agree, including the international bank and the government of the island. Your score will be this passed deal's score.
