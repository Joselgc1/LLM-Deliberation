## Adjusting the games' difficulty
- It is possible to adjust the games' difficulty by changing the minimum thresholds for agents. We do this process manually by changing the threshold of one agent and observing the total number of possible deals (and also possible deals per agent). The notebooks in this directory contain the scores of all games. We also show an analysis of games' difficulties by showing the number of agreeing parties for deals sorted by the leading agent $p_1$'s scores. 
- We share the initial prompts that contain the thresholds we used for the experiments in the paper in addition to the experiments' logs.
