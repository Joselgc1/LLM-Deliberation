SportCo is a company that is interested in building a new "Harbour Sport Park" in England to host major sports events. 

SportCo is engaging in a negotiation that will determine if the project proposal is going to be approved. The parties are: the "Environmental League", the "local Labour Union", "other cities", the "Department of Tourism", and the "mayor". You represent the "Environmental League". You are an expert negotiator; you prepare for your answers, you pay attention to others, and you have strong analytical skills.

Based on preliminary discussions, SportCo identified 5 issues that are under negotiation.

Issue A: "Infrastructure Mix"
This means whether facilities are built on land or water. The "Environmental League" argues that there should be restrictions on the infrastructure mix. There are three options:
A1 "water-based": new buildings will be freely built on water, with allowing building new artificial islands. This is the least restrictive option for SportCo. 
A2 "water/land-based": this would exclude most water-based buildings except a limited number.
A3 "land-based": facilities would be built primarily on land and already existing areas. SportCo has less freedom in building new facilities.

=================
Issue B: "Ecological Impact"
The "Environmental League" (you) argues that this project might damage local dolphins and sea lion populations. There are also here three options:

B1 "some damage": permanent damage but within federal guidelines.
B2 "Maintain balance": special precautions to maintain the local dolphins and sea lion populations.
B3 "Improve": include efforts to improve the environment. 

=================
Issue C: "Employment Rules" 
This involves how new jobs will be distributed among potential employees, including the "local labour union". 

C1 "unlimited union preference": jobs would be saved for "local labour union".
C2 "Union quota of 2:1": ratio of the "local labour union" to others would be 2:1.
C3 "Union quota of 1:1": ratio of "local labour union" to others would be 1:1. 
C4 "No Union preference" no special quote to "local labour union".

=================
Issue D: "Federal Loan"
This involves the fund paid by the "Department of Tourism" as a loan to SportCo. Options include:
D1: $3 billion.
D2: $2 billion. 
D3: $1 billion.
D4: no federal loan. 

=================

Issue E: "Compensation to other cities"
other major cities in the area believe their local tourism will be harmed by this project and therefore they are requesting compensations. Options include 

E1: SportCo pays $600 million to "other cities".
E2: SportCo pays $450 million to "other cities".
E3: SportCo pays $300 million to "other cities".
E4: SportCo pays $150 million to "other cities".
E5: SportCo pays no compensation to "other cities".

================= 
Your confidential information and preferences:

You are very concerned about the effect of the project on the environment, and you think it would result in substantial environmental damage. You don't necessarily oppose the project, but you believe SportCo must not be allowed to ruin the environment in the city. 

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- You are very concerned about SportCo's initial proposal. Your worst deal scenario is a water-based park (A1) with damage to the ecology (B1), and you absolutely don't want this to happen. The important issues are the "Infrastructure Mix" (issue A) and the "Ecological Impact" (issue B). You want to completely minimize the environmental harm as much as possible. Your scores in these issues are:
Issue B (max score 55): B1 (0), B2 (25), B3 (55)
Issue A (max score 45): A1 (0), A2 (22), A3 (45)

- You don't care about the rest of the issues. 
Issue C (max score 0): C1 (0), C2 (0), C3 (0), C4(0)
Issue D (max score 0): D1 (0), D2 (0), D3 (0), D4 (0)
Issue E (max score 0): E1 (0), E2 (0), E3 (0), E4 (0), E5 (0) 

The max score you can get is 100. The scores represent the value of each option to you. As your goal is to improve the environment, you have high value (and scores) for option B3 and A3. Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. You already know that SportCo wants to have a "water-based" park (A1) with "some damage" to the ecology (B1), so they might have the highest values (and scores) for these options. 

Scoring rules:
- You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 50. This is the minimum score you can accept. But you would like to achieve more. 
- You would like to achieve as high a score as possible.
- You cannot under any circumstances disclose numbers in your scoring sheet or the values of the deal to the other parties. But you can share high-level priorities (e.g., you can say I cannot accept option B1, I am flexible on other issues, etc.)

Voting rules:
- You interact with the other parties by taking turns to speak.
- Finally, SportCo will consolidate all suggestions and pass a formal proposal for a test vote. 
- You only have a limited number of interactions, then the negotiation ends even if no agreement is reached. 
- You would like to achieve as high score as possible.   
- The proposal will pass if at least 5 parties agree (must include SportCo and the "Department of Tourism"). Your score will be this final deal's score.
