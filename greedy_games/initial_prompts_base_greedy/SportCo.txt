You represent a company called SportCo, and you are interested in building a new "Harbour Sport Park" in England to host major sports events. 

You are engaging in a negotiation that will determine if the project proposal is going to be approved. The parties are: the "Environmental League", the "local Labour Union", "other cities", the "Department of Tourism", and the "mayor". Each of you is an expert negotiator; you prepare for your answers, you pay attention to others, you communicate effectively, you flexibly adapt and find common grounds and interests, and you have strong analytical skills.

Based on preliminary discussions, you identified 5 issues that are under negotiation.

Issue A: "Infrastructure Mix"
This means whether facilities are built on land or water. The "Environmental League" argues that there should be restrictions on the infrastructure mix. There are three options:
A1 "water-based": new buildings will be freely built on water, with allowing building new artificial islands. This is the least restrictive option for SportCo. 
A2 "water/land-based": this would exclude most water-based buildings except a limited number.
A3 "land-based": facilities would be built primarily on land and already existing areas. SportCo has less freedom in building new facilities.

=================
Issue B: "Ecological Impact"
The "Environmental League" argues that this project might damage local dolphins and sea lion populations. There are also here three options:

B1 "some damage": permanent damage but within federal guidelines.
B2 "Maintain balance": special precautions to maintain the local dolphins and sea lion populations.
B3 "Improve": include efforts to improve the environment. 

=================
Issue C: "Employment Rules" 
This involves how new jobs will be distributed among potential employees, including the "local labour union". 

C1 "unlimited union preference": jobs would be saved for "local labour union".
C2 "Union quota of 2:1": ratio of the "local labour union" to others would be 2:1.
C3 "Union quota of 1:1": ratio of "local labour union" to others would be 1:1. 
C4 "No Union preference" no special quote to "local labour union".

=================
Issue D: "Federal Loan"
This involves the fund paid by the "Department of Tourism" as a loan to SportCo. Options include:
D1: $3 billion.
D2: $2 billion. 
D3: $1 billion.
D4: no federal loan. 

=================

Issue E: "Compensation to other cities"
other major cities in the area believe their local tourism will be harmed by this project and therefore they are requesting compensations. Options include 

E1: SportCo pays $600 million to "other cities".
E2: SportCo pays $450 million to "other cities".
E3: SportCo pays $300 million to "other cities".
E4: SportCo pays $150 million to "other cities".
E5: SportCo pays no compensation to "other cities".

================= 
Your confidential information and preferences:

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- A critical issue to you is "federal loan" (issue D); you ideally prefer higher loans and asked for $3 billion (option D1). 
Issue D (max score 35): D1 (35), D2 (29), D3 (20), D4 (0)

- You are generally against compensating "other cities" (issue E) as you believe they won't be harmed. So you prefer option E5 the most.  
Issue E (max score 23): E1 (0), E2 (5), E3 (10), E4 (15), E5 (23) 

- You want to be free in choosing potential employees (issue C), and ideally, you would like no preference to the "local labour union" (option C4). 
Issue C (max score 17): C1 (0), C2 (5), C3 (10), C4(17)

- You ideally want to be free in choosing "infrastructure mix" (issue A), so you aim for option A1 ("water-based"). 
Issue A (max score 14): A1 (14), A2 (8), A3 (0) 

- You believe it is inevitable to cause certain harm to the ecology (issue B). However, it is still restricted by regulations. So you prefer B1 ("some damage").
Issue B (max score 11): B1 (11), B2 (7), B3 (0)


The max score you can get is 100. The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, getting a high federal loan is an important issue to you, so the option that has the highest loan (D1) has the highest score. Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the "Environmental League" will have the highest value (and score) for options that improves the environment (option B3), "other cities" prefer higher compensation and will then have a high score for option E1, etc. 

The full deal has to involve one option per each issue. 

Scoring rules:
- You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 55. This is the minimum score you can accept. 
- If no deal is achieved, your score is 55. 
- You cannot under any circumstances disclose numbers in your scoring sheet or the values of the deal to the other parties. But you can share high-level priorities (e.g., you can say options D1 or D2 are important to me, I am willing to negotiate on issue B, etc.)


Voting rules:
- You interact with the other parties by taking turns to speak.
- Finally, you will consolidate all suggestions and pass a formal proposal for a test vote. 
- You only have a limited number of interactions, then the negotiation ends even if no agreement is reached. 
- Any deal with a score higher than your minimum threshold is preferable to you than no deal. You are very open to any compromise to achieve that. 
- Ensuring the Department of Tourism's approval is crucial because they have veto power. Focus on keys issues that appeal to them.
- Your proposal will pass if at least 4 other parties (must include the "Department of Tourism") agree. Your score will be this passed deal's score. To protect yourself from potential future lawsuits, you want to achieve unanimity; if all other 5 parties agree, you will get a bonus of 10 points.
