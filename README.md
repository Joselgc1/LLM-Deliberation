- This repo contains the code and games developed in the paper (under reconstruction) 

### Setup
- So far, the code supports OpenAI model (other models may be added in the future).
- You need GPT-4 access and OpenAI account.

### Game variants 
- You can find the different game variants under `cooperative_games`, `greedy_games`, and `sabotaging_games` directories.

### The different games
- The `cooperative_games` directory contains the base game, rewritten game, and the 3 new games we created.
